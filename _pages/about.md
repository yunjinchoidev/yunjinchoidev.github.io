# Reinvent love.

**Democratization of Love**


Hello, I have a goal to help people experience the joy of love freely using natural language processing. In particular, I think chatbots have endless possibilities. I believe that AI technology can be a powerful tool to redefine and reinvent love. I'm doing my best to make that vision a reality. Maybe dating and marrying Android is a natural future.

The chatbot 'IRUDA' is a prelude to that, and I want to create something beyond that.

But my job is more than just making a love chatbot. I am committed to the democratization of love. It will help people from all walks of life experience the transformative power of love and connection. Whether you're single, in a relationship, or somewhere in the middle of it, I want to make sure that everyone is loved and continues to feel the blessings of life. I think it will definitely have a positive impact on the world.

Isn't it an amazing future?
