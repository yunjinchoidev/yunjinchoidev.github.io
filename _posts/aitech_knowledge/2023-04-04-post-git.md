# What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for the development of the Linux kernel. Git provides a way to manage changes made by multiple contributors to a project and makes it easy to track the history of changes. It is widely used in software development, and it has become an essential tool for developers.

# Git Terminology
Before diving into the Git command, it is essential to understand some of the terminologies associated with Git.

# Repository
A Git repository is a directory that contains the files and history of a project. It is also known as a repo. The repository can be located on a local machine or a remote server.

# Commit
A commit is a snapshot of changes made to a repository. Each commit has a unique identifier known as a hash, which allows you to track changes in the repository's history.

# Branch
A branch is a version of the repository that allows you to work on different features or fixes without affecting the main branch. You can create, delete, and merge branches in Git.

# Merge
Merging is the process of combining two or more branches into a single branch. It is usually done when you have finished working on a feature branch and want to integrate it into the main branch.

# Git Command
Git command is a set of instructions that allows you to interact with the Git repository. Here are some of the essential Git commands for beginners:

# git init
This command initializes a new Git repository in the current directory. It creates a hidden directory called .git, which contains all the necessary files to manage the repository.

# git add
This command adds files to the staging area. The staging area is a temporary storage area where you can prepare changes before committing them to the repository.

# git commit
This command creates a new commit with the changes made in the staging area. It opens a text editor where you can add a commit message that describes the changes made in the commit.

# git status
This command shows the status of the repository. It shows which files are modified, which files are staged, and which files are not tracked by Git.

# git log
This command shows the history of commits made in the repository. It shows the commit hash, author, date, and commit message for each commit.

# git branch
This command shows a list of branches in the repository. It also shows the current branch, which is highlighted with an asterisk (*).

# git checkout
This command allows you to switch to a different branch. You can create a new branch and switch to it using this command.

# git merge
This command merges a branch into the current branch. It is used to integrate changes made in one branch into another branch.

# git clone
This command creates a copy of a remote repository on your local machine.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, Git is an essential tool for software development, and understanding the Git command is crucial for managing changes made to a project. We hope this guide has provided you with a solid foundation in Git and helped you understand the basic terminologies and commands associated with Git. By mastering Git, you can become a more efficient

## 명령어 별명 지정하기
다음 명령어를 치면 git l 로 log를 볼 수 있다.
`git config --global alias.l "log --oneline --all --graph"`

## -a 와 add 의 차이
- -a 옵션은 `tracked` 상태의 파일만 `auto adding` 해준다.
- add : untracked -> tracked

## .gitignore
절대 커밋하면 안되는 파일 ? 우린 config.txt를 무시하도록 하고 싶다. config.txt 를 절대 커밋하면 안된다. 어떻게 해야 할 까? ->  깃이 무시하도록 처리해야 한다. .gitignore 파일을 만들어서 처리한다.  -> .gitignore에 무시하고자 하는 파일을 추가한다. -> 결과 : 파일이 status에 더 이상 나타나지 않는 것을 확인한다.

그렇다면 어떻게 config.txt 를 어떻게 관리해야 하나 ? 게시판에 올려놓고 공유하나 ? 메일로 공유하나 ? 

config.txt.template 파일을 만들어서 이 파일을 저장한다. 
database_id:USER_ID
database_password:USER_PASSWORD


## checkout VS reset
checkout = HEAD를 바꾼다. 
reset = HEAD의 Branch를 바꾼다.

## conflict

## fetch + merge = pull
